# Armenian language

# Why

Armenian is my native language, but not literal, but rural Western Armenian. Studying Eastern Armenian is a challenge but it's required since I would like to know my roots.

# Challenges

- **Alphabet** - it's unique, not similar to any other language. Some characters are very similar to Latin characters but they have a different sound. For example, Armenian **Ս** is Latin **S**, and Armenian **Տ** is Latin **T**.

- **Sounds** - some sounds in Armenian are repeated with 'h'. It requires additional attention to translating from sound to text.

- **Unique vocabulary** - Armenian language has many unique words. Actually, most words are unique words with some vocabulary derived from Russian and French languages.
