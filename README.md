# Personal studies by Ivan Begtin

My studies: spoken languages, programming languages, and everything else. Guidelines, roadmaps, timelines and resources.

# Why and what for?

I have mixed Russian, Armenian and Polish ancestry but I don't know Armenian or Polish well enough. I know only several phrases in Western Armenian, but not Eastern Armenian which is the language standard. 

I have a lot of knowledge in technical areas like Python programming, data engineering, it management, computer forensics, digital preservation, and open data, but also I have a lot of gaps in other computer science studies.

So I've started my systematic studies since I feel quite mature and I find that regular studies, education, and self-education are the only way to keep my mind sharp.

# How to

More details [how to](howto.md) start new studies and how to keep studying in memory.

# Spoken languages

My primary spoken language is Russian also I know English, not ideally, but I can read, write and talk and even read scientific papers. It's not so hard to study Slavic languages.

## Current studies

- [**Armenian**](spokenlang/armenian/README.md) - old Middle-east language, about 3m speakers in Armenia and about 12m  armenians around the world (not every armenian is the armenian-language speaker).

- **[Polish](spokenlang/polish/README.md)** - west Slavic language, similar to Russian but not so similar as Bulgarian or Serbian. 

- **[Latin](spokenlang/latin/README.md)** - ancient language, mother of most European Romanian languages. Most of the English scientific vocabulary is from Latin.

## Plans

* Spanish - it's popular, sounds good, and should be easy after Latin

* Chinese - China is a huge country with 1B speakers of Chinese. It is worth at least being able to read it.

* Arabic - it's very unusual, not very common

## Under consideration)

Not really sure about that:

- German

- Francais



# Writing

I write a lot, especially in Russian, but it's short texts in Telegram format. Rarely do I write long technical texts in English and Russian. My goal is regular writing in Russian, English, and other languages. 

## Current studies

* Regular text writing in Russian and English

* Writing stories in English

## Plans

* Writing stories in Armenian and Polish
