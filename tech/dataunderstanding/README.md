# Data understanding

Mix of notes in English/Russian about nature of data.

# Why ?

It's a long term interest in understanding data. I would like to have deeper knowledge in this topic.


# Key ideas
* Data generation is 'well-patterned', it could be explained in a short number of rules based on technology limitations, human psychology and simple logic.
* There are limited semantic data types that would cover most of generated data
* Data visualization could be automated, data discovery could be much easier

# Goals
* Personal knowledge improvement (need to specify metrics)
* Preparing DE course in Russian
* Scientific article(-s)

# Roadmap

## Stage 1. Basic understanding
1. Review existing scientific articles about semantic data types using Semantic Scholar
2. Create list of the most interesting articles and key ideas
3. Write mind map/record brainstorm of key ideas
4. Write an essay with findings

## Stage 2. Review
* Find more related publications.
...
* Write scientific article about that
