# How to study

Studying anything new is a project. I can organize it with a Gantt chart and timeline, or agile sprints, or by using any other methodology but it is a project. Sometimes I can, sometimes I can't predict how long time studying something new will take. 

## Understand your needs

What do you need and want to study? Is it your personal passion or an urgent need under a pressure? 

## Understand your resources

You can't study everything you may want. It's important to measure time, money, and other resources needed to study.

## Write a roadmap

Prepare a plan, and write a roadmap, measure your success and failures.

## Consistency is the key

Follow the plan and roadmap. Study regularly, write about studies, and update regularly.
